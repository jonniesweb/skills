# Refine Plan

Carefully verify that a plan makes sense and is the best way to implement the functionality.

## Instructions

1. Review the current implementation plan
2. Verify the approach:
   - Is this the best way to implement this functionality?
   - Are there simpler alternatives?
   - Does it follow existing codebase patterns?
3. Check for completeness:
   - Are there other places in the codebase that should be updated?
   - Are there related tests that need updating?
   - Are there documentation or configuration changes needed?
4. Evaluate complexity:
   - If any steps are too large or complicated, split them into smaller steps
   - Each step should be independently verifiable
5. Consider edge cases and error handling
6. Present refined plan with any suggested changes
